**Prime Game**

This project challenges you with a competitive game involving prime numbers and strategic removal of integers. You'll leverage concepts such as:

- **Prime Numbers:** Understanding prime numbers and efficient prime identification algorithms (Sieve of Eratosthenes).
- **Game Theory:** Principles of competitive games, optimal play, and win conditions.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Optimizing calculations for multiple game rounds using memoization.

**Problem:**

Given a set of consecutive integers and a series of rounds, the goal is to determine the winner of a game where players take turns removing prime numbers and their multiples from the set. The game ends when no player can make a move.

**Instructions:**

1. Implement a function `isWinner(x, nums)` that returns the name of the player with the most wins over `x` rounds, where `nums` is an array of integers.
2. Ensure your solution handles cases where the winner cannot be determined (return `None`).
3. Follow Python coding standards (PEP 8).
